    " - abstract model\n",
    " - explicitly defines the structure of data\n",
    " - Makes some things easier to express than others\n",
    " - Will use a relational model\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Relational data model** \n",
    "\n",
    " - a data set is an ordered set called table of tuples called rows. \n",
    " - Where every tuple is composed of simple values such as numbers or strings.\n",
    " - A position of a value within a tuple is a column. And column defines value semantics.\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/week_51.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graph data model**\n",
    "\n",
    " - A graph consist of vertices and edges.\n",
    " - vertices: represent entities. Movies, actors, directors, titles, and so on.\n",
    " - edges: represent relations between entities.\n",

    "1. Columnar stores are highly efficient in terms of CPU usage.databases were storing data row by row, linearly. They would completely serialize one row before continuing to the other ---> if you need to read the values from just one particular column, you still need to read the whole table.\n",

    "2. Columnar stores transpose data layout and store all the values column by column, enabling two key optimizations:\n",
    " - you can efficiently scan only the necessary data. \n",
    " - you can achieve better compression ratios, because column-wise, data is more regular and more repetitive, and hence, more compressible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons of columnar:**\n",
    "1. row assembly -To reconstruct the full row, you need to perform lookups from all the columns, which is likely to cause more input and output operations. However, by accessing the subset of columns, you can reduce the number of input and output operations.\n",

    " - sync markers are used to make a splittable format.\n",
    "- Data types: BYTE STRINGS \n",
    " - RCFiles are untyped. And values are treated as bytes. \n",
    " - The reason for that is because RCFiles are mostly used in conjunction with Hive. And Hive deals with all the serialization and deserialization. So there is no need to offload this functionality to the format.\n",
    "- Extensibility: NO \n",

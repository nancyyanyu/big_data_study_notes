    "## What is Hadoop Streaming?\n",
    "Hadoop streaming is a utility that comes with the Hadoop distribution. The utility allows you to create and run Map/Reduce jobs with any executable or script as the mapper and/or the reducer. For example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop  jar $HADOOP_HOME/hadoop-streaming.jar \\\n",
    "    -input myInputDirs \\\n",

    "\n",
    "1. define the path to the streaming jar\n",
    " - Where this jar is located depends on your cluster installation\n",
    "2. execute yarn application\n",
    "3. provide a number of arguments\n",
    " - mapper: bash command wc-l. \n",
    " - numReducesTasks: For now, you don't want to execute any reducers, \n",
    " - input: specify what HDFS folder or file you are going to process\n",
